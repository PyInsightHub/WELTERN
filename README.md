# 📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis

End-to-End Data Analytics  | Internship – Week 1 (Weltern)

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis on a large-scale Amazon Sales Dataset (100,000+ records).
It is part of my Week 1 internship work at Weltern, aimed at building strong foundations in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and business insights generation using Python.

The analysis helps uncover meaningful trends related to sales performance, customer behavior, pricing factors, and revenue growth.
